### About Me
I’m building my career in **AI / ML Engineering**, developing open-source PoCs that demonstrate real end-to-end, production-grade skills.  
I build testable software with **Node.js/TypeScript (React, NestJS)**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Docker**, always with a focus on clean architecture, typed APIs, CI, and observability.  
My PoCs are **AI-ready** (mocked endpoints designed to be swapped with real ML models) and showcase complete delivery pipelines.  

With a background in **academic research**, I’m trained to analyze complex problems and design structured solutions.  
Problem-solving is second nature to me — I enjoy turning challenges into working systems that are both reliable and easy to understand.  

Based in France. Open to **AI / ML Engineer** roles.
